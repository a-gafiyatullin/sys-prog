1) Self synchronization:
    Because of the way code points are assigned, it is possible to find the
    beginning of each character by looking only at the top two bits of each byte. This can
    have important performance implications when performing searches in text.
2) Encoding of code sequence length:
    The number of bytes in the sequence is indicated by the
    pattern of bits in the first byte of the sequence. Thus, the beginning of the next character
    can be found quickly. This feature can also have important performance implications
    when performing searches in text.
3) Efficient code structure:
    UTF-8 efficiently encodes the UCS code points. The high-order
    bits of the code point go in the lead byte. Lower-order bits are placed in continuation
    bytes. The number of bytes in the encoding is the minimum required to hold all the sig-
    nificant bits of the code point.
